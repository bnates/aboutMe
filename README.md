aboutMe
I first want the user to tell me there name
then I go into a quick quiz
my favorite color
if I have a cat
a question about my fav game
if I love sleep
if I cook
I then ask what my fav number is
  giving them 5 tries
Finally I ask them to guess what I call my cat
  giving 6 tries
  along with 5 possible answers
At the end of my java script I tally the score of the correct answers
